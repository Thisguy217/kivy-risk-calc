# kivy-risk-game

This requires the Kivy Virtual Enviroment build inorder to actually run it, but I built it with the goal of porting to either Android or both Android/iOS.
I am trying to figure out how to upload it in the first place to either one, but we will see about that, I will probably upload the apk on this repository when I figure it out.
Any additional features are totally open and I have another repository that has a tkinter version.
